      passage:
        "Digital literacy is the ability to find, evaluate, and communicate information using digital platforms. In Nigeria, the shift toward computer-based testing (CBT) has forced many students to become more comfortable with technology. While this transition was initially met with resistance due to poor infrastructure, the benefits—such as immediate results and reduced examination malpractice—have made it a mainstay in the educational system. However, the digital divide remains a challenge, as students in rural areas often lack the same access to high-speed internet and modern hardware as their urban counterparts.",
